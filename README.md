The analysis script included for the the manuscript entitled Evaluating the development and well-being assessment (DAWBA) in pediatric anxiety and depression. This script includes the regression analyses done in the manuscript and each analysis is labeled with its corresponding manuscript's section. 

In this repository, we are only sharing the analysis script and not the actual dataset. The decision to restrict access to the dataset stems from the fact that only a limited number of subjects in our study consented to their data being shared publicly. Although we are unable to provide the raw data at this time, we encourage users to apply these scripts to their own datasets.
