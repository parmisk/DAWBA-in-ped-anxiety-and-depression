Analysis code to accompany the manuscript “[Evaluating the development and well-being assessment (DAWBA) in pediatric anxiety and depression](https://capmh.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13034-023-00696-7)”  published in the journal *Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Mental Health*.

This repository contains R scripts used for processing and analysis.
 
The R script, written in R Markdown used R v4.2.1 and R Studio v2022.07.01. Packages included `tidyverse, dplyr` (data manipulation), `ggplot2, hrbrthemes, gdtools, ggpubr, ggExtra, ggMarginal, patchwork` (plotting and formatting of figures), and `psych, lm.beta, multcomp, compute.es, scales` (statistics and functions).
 
The script calculates average and change scores for anxiety (SCARED) and depression (MFQ) child- and parent reports and performs linear regression models to assess the association between DAWBA band scores, symptom measures, and treatment outcomes. Sections in the script are labeled in accordance with the manuscript sections.

The dataset associated with these scripts is currently not shared publicly due to confidentiality and sensitivity issues.
